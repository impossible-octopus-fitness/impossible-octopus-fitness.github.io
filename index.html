                        <p>Now, you'll quickly notice that arm wresting an octopus will very often leave you the winner. I've heard some use strong language about octopuses based on that mere fact. But those foul mouths are missing the big picture.</p>

                        <p>Be humble, and look at what a tentacle can do. Then, look at your own arm. You see where I'm going.</p>

                        <p>Tentacles are able to do so much more than those rigid limbs we call our arms. Try to get your arm to do a tentacle move. Try again. And again. Soon, you arm will move just like a tentacle.</p>

                        <p>And if you're still feeling doubts over octopuses' strength based on their arm-wrestling skills, note that they tend to be sore losers. Grin a bit too much, and you'll soon feel tentacles surround your body, and crush all of your bones. Then, you'll feel the power of the tentacle muscle.</p>

                    <h2><span>Launching the Impossible Octopus Fitness today</span></h2>
                    <p class="author-date">By Rudy Rigot, on February 3rd 2016</p>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>Two years ago, I found myself lost in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, trying to swim to the nearest island. (How I got there is a entirely other story. Long story short: don't plan on a parachute jump in the middle of the ocean without arranging for someone to come pick you up after you've landed. Learned it the hard way.)</p>

                        <p>Anyway, fast forward ten days later, it was starting to feel a bit long-ish. But suddenly, I felt a tentacle around my ankle, and very quickly an octopus, was there, at the surface with me, smiling at me (I swear it was).</p>

                        <p>The octopus told me in octopus language: "Come on man! You've got to flex that muscle!", and just went on its way.</p>

                        <p>Shortly thereafter, I was finding an inhabited island, and made it to safety. I'm positive that what saved me was that octopus (not at all the 10 days of continuous swim).</p>

                        <p>Some people have said it's impossible, and I must have had visions from the mild exhaustion I was starting to feel, but what I'm saying is: octopus fitness saved me! Impossible you say? Then, let's practice Impossible Octopus Fitness together!</p>
