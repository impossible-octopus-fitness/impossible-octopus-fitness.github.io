                        <p>Now, you'll quickly notice that arm wresting an octopus will very often leave you the winner. I've heard some use strong language about octopuses based on that mere fact. But those foul mouths are missing the big picture.</p>

                        <p>Be humble, and look at what a tentacle can do. Then, look at your own arm. You see where I'm going.</p>

                        <p>Two years ago, I found myself lost in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, trying to swim to the nearest island. (How I got there is a entirely other story. Long story short: don't plan on a parachute jump in the middle of the ocean without arranging for someone to come pick you up after you've landed. Learned it the hard way.)</p>
