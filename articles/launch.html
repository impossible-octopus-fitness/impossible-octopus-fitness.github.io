                    <div class="content">
                        <p>Two years ago, I found myself lost in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, trying to swim to the nearest island. (How I got there is a entirely other story. Long story short: don't plan on a parachute jump in the middle of the ocean without arranging for someone to come pick you up after you've landed. Learned it the hard way.)</p>

                        <p>Anyway, fast forward ten days later, it was starting to feel a bit long-ish. But suddenly, I felt a tentacle around my ankle, and very quickly an octopus, was there, at the surface with me, smiling at me (I swear it was).</p>

                        <p>The octopus told me in octopus language: "Come on man! You've got to flex that muscle!", and just went on its way.</p>

                        <p>Shortly thereafter, I was finding an inhabited island, and made it to safety. I'm positive that what saved me was that octopus (not at all the 10 days of continuous swim).</p>

                        <p>Some people have said it's impossible, and I must have had visions from the mild exhaustion I was starting to feel, but what I'm saying is: octopus fitness saved me! Impossible you say? Then, let's practice Impossible Octopus Fitness together!</p>
